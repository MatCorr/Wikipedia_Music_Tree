Introduction\n\nOne of the best sources of the internet for textual information, Wikipedia has a lot of articles filled with details about thousands of musical acts. More importantly for this work, the Wikipedia articles of these artists often feature mentions to others. Take this example extracted from the Wikipedia page on Bob Dylan.\n\n_\"Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included **the Byrds**, **Sonny & Cher**, **the Hollies**, **Peter, Paul and Mary**, **the Association**, **Manfred Mann** and **the Turtles**.\"_\n\nIn just one sentence, we have references to seven other artists, and mentions such as those are spread throughout the article, showing acts who are somehow linked to Bob Dylan, whether they influenced him, were influenced by him, or something else entirely.\n\nGiven a dataset containing for each artist the number of references its Wikipedia article makes to other artists, this notebook plans to use that information to calculate the similarity between musical acts.\n\n## 2.

Cosine Similarity has the benefit of yielding a similarity score whose meaning is easy to identify, since it will always range between 0 (minimum similarity) and 1 (maximum similarity). However, during the development of this notebook, it was observed that the Consine Similarity metric may not be ideal for this task. That's because - in many cases - very obscure artists got the highest similarity scores simply because the only artist that is mentioned in their article or the only artist that mentions them happened to overlap with one of those of the selected artist.\n\nObscure artists getting the highest similarity is not the issue here. The problem is that if the only artist they mention or that mentions them overlaps with one of those of the selected artist, they will probably get a much higher score than popular artists that have multiple overlaps with the act selected by the user.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it would be interesting to use or build a similarity metric that takes more heavily into account the total of overlapping artists.","metadata":{}}]}
